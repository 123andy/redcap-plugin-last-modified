# redcap-plugin-last-modified
An API-like plugin that returns record modification timestamps and details.  

This script tries to output a list of last modified dates for records in a project.
This is used by a cron task to keep data in a large redcap project in sync with an outside system.  Rather than re-pushing the entire dataset every interval, only those records that have been modified are pushed to the external system.

Requires:
*	token = API TOKEN

Optional:
*	record = a single record id, or an array of record ids to filter by
*	format = csv or json (default) to control the output format
*	delta = restrict to records last modified in past h:m:s
*	since = log timestamp to begin search on (yyyymmddhhmmss).  If specified, only times >= this will be used.

Output contains:
*	pk (primary key or record_id)
*	event (UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE)
*	ts (timestamp in format YmdHis)
